                    <span class="font-bold">Dmitri Vinnikov (Fellow, IEEE)</span> earned his Dipl.Eng., M.Sc., and
                    Dr.Sc.techn. degrees in electrical
                    engineering from Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia, in 1999, 2001, and 2005, respectively.
                    He is currently the Head of the Power Electronics Group, Department of Electrical Power Engineering
                    and Mechatronics, Tallinn University of Technology. Since 2021 he is a member of the Estonian
                    Academy of Sciences. He was one of the founders of ZEBEâ€”Estonian Centre of Excellence for zero
                    energy and resource efficient smart buildings and districts. He has authored or coauthored three
                    books, five monographs and several book chapters as well as more than 400 published papers on power
                    converter design and development and is the holder of numerous patents and utility models in this
                    field. His research interests include applied design of power electronic systems, implementation of
                    wide-bandgap semiconductors, renewable energy conversion systems, energy-efficient buildings,
                    reliability and fault-tolerance of power electronic converters. He is an associate editor of several
                    IEEE journals (IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, IEEE Open Journal of the Industrial
                    Electronics Society, and IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics). In 2016 he founded the joint
                    IES/PELS Chapter of the IEEE Estonia Section and served as a Chapter Chair with the view to promote
                    the discipline and profession in Estonia and Baltic countries through a variety of activities. In
                    2020 he was elected as a Chair of the IEEE Estonia Section.
